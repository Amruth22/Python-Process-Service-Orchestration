# Process-Based Service Orchestration - Question Description

## Overview

Build a process-based service orchestration system using Python multiprocessing to create microservices-like architecture where multiple services run as separate OS processes. This project demonstrates inter-process communication, shared memory management, service registry patterns, and health monitoring for distributed systems.

## Project Objectives

1. **Process-Based Service Architecture:** Learn to design and implement services that run as independent OS processes, understanding the benefits of process isolation, true parallelism, and fault tolerance.

2. **Python Multiprocessing:** Master the multiprocessing module including Process creation, Queue-based communication, shared memory with Manager, and process synchronization techniques.

3. **Inter-Service Communication:** Implement robust communication patterns between services using queues, understand message protocols, handle timeouts, and manage asynchronous request/response patterns.

4. **Shared Memory Management:** Learn to use shared memory for cross-process data sharing, implement thread-safe access with locks, and manage shared statistics and state.

5. **Service Registry Pattern:** Build a service discovery system that tracks running services, stores metadata, enables service lookup, and manages service lifecycle.

6. **Health Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive health checking including process liveness checks, heartbeat monitoring, automatic service restart, and performance tracking.

## Key Features to Implement

- **Multiple Process-Based Services:**
  - UserService for user management
  - OrderService for order processing with inter-service calls
  - NotificationService for asynchronous notifications
  - Each service running in isolated process

- **Inter-Process Communication:**
  - Queue-based message passing
  - Standard message protocol
  - Request/response pattern
  - Timeout handling

- **Shared Memory:**
  - Shared statistics across services
  - Heartbeat tracking
  - Request counters
  - Thread-safe access with locks

- **Service Registry:**
  - Automatic service registration
  - Service discovery by name
  - Metadata storage (PID, queues, status)
  - Service deregistration

- **Health Monitoring:**
  - Process health checks
  - Heartbeat monitoring
  - Auto-restart capability
  - Statistics tracking

- **HTTP Gateway:**
  - REST API for service access
  - Gateway pattern implementation
  - Service proxy functionality

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Process vs Thread Understanding:** Learning when to use processes vs threads, understanding the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, and recognizing the trade-offs between isolation and resource usage.

- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Mastering different IPC mechanisms (Queue, Pipe, Shared Memory), understanding their performance characteristics, and choosing the right method for each use case.

- **Process Synchronization:** Implementing thread-safe access to shared resources, using locks and semaphores correctly, and avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.

- **Service Orchestration:** Managing multiple service lifecycles, handling service dependencies, implementing graceful startup and shutdown, and coordinating service interactions.

- **Fault Tolerance:** Detecting service failures, implementing automatic recovery, handling partial system failures, and maintaining system stability.

- **Message Protocol Design:** Creating standard message formats, implementing request/response patterns, handling message routing, and managing timeouts.

- **Health Monitoring Strategy:** Designing effective health checks, implementing heartbeat mechanisms, setting appropriate timeouts, and balancing monitoring overhead.

## Expected Outcome

You will create a functional process-based service orchestration system that demonstrates microservices architecture patterns using Python's multiprocessing capabilities. The system will showcase service isolation, inter-service communication, health monitoring, and service discovery patterns.
